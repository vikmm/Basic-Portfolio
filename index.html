  <p>My name is Victor Montemayor, I am currently in the UT Bootcamp. Growing up I was into different types of hobbies from jumping dirt hills on a BMX to playing drums in my parents garage. I was playing drums in bands from the age of 18, but music has always been a big part of my life. I love adventure, roadtrips, shooting on a Super 8, creating music, and art installations.</p>
  <p>Being a drafter since 2005 I truly think its time for a change. Coding is something new to me, but yet very interesting. I am excited to see where this new career path takes me.</p>
